<h2 class="sans">"THE PAPER OF THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW."</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[In one of the magazines an entire
article has been transmitted to the
office, not by the post, but by mental
suggestion.&mdash;<i>News paragraph.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">SCENE</span>&mdash;<i>Editor's Room of "The
Mental Mirror of the Universe."</i>
<span class="sc">TIME</span>&mdash;<i>An hour before
publication.</i> Editor <i>and</i> Chief-Sub.
<i>discovered in consultation</i>.</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Dear me, Mr. <span class="sc">Payste</span>,
this is very annoying! Debate on
Africa in the House to-night, and
our leader-writer has sent in no
copy! Why did you not communicate
with me?</p>

<p><i>Chief-Sub.</i> Well, Sir, as you
were dining with the Duke, I did
not like to disturb you, especially
as I had arranged matters. I
have got some one else to knock
off the article.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Very good, and where does
it come from?</p>

<p><i>Chief-Sub.</i> I turned on the
mentophone and found Lord <span class="sc">Macaulay</span>
disengaged.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Of course he writes smartly
enough, but I should have thought
he was scarcely sufficiently well-up
in the subject.</p>

<p><i>Chief-Sub.</i> So he said, Sir: so
we applied to Sir <span class="sc">Walter Raleigh</span>,
who has sent in a good
column.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> His English, I am afraid,
is a trifle old-fashioned.</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Well, yes, Sir; a
little. But I gave it to one of
our subs. who has made black
letter a study, and between them
they have turned out a very decent
leader. Sorry to say the wire
has broken down between London
and the seat of the war, so we
have no despatches.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Distinctly annoying! However,
I think I can put myself in
communication with our special.
(<i>Takes a pen in his right hand,
and commences writing.</i>) Well,
what next?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> But shall I not disturb
you?</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Not at all; my right hand
is in sympathy with <span class="sc">Longbow</span>,
so I need not pay any attention
to what he is sending us until he
gets to the end of his copy.
Everything else right?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> I think I may venture
to say "Yes," Sir. Mrs.
<span class="sc">Covers</span>, who does our reviews,
has neglected to send in her stuff,
but I have used the mentophone
again in that case. Put on
<span class="sc">Charles Lamb</span>. And I think
that's all, save, as there is a
letter about the authorship of
<i>Hamlet</i>, I have got <span class="sc">William
Shakspeare</span> to answer it himself.
And now, Sir, I would
suggest that, as we are rather
full up this evening, you might
conclude that dispatch as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> My hand has just done
writing. (<i>Gives copy to</i> Chief
Sub.) Anything worth a line for
the bill?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> (<i>after perusal</i>).
Well, yes, Sir. I find there has
been a battle, so we may as well
give that.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Everything right now?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Everything, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i> Well, now you can send
down the paper to press as soon as
you please. (<i>Exit</i> Chief Sub. <i>to
carry out directions</i>.) Dear me! It
really simplifies matters considerably
when waves of thought will
do as well as the electric telegraph.</p>

<h3>TO THE SEA.</h3>

<h4><i>An Expostulation.</i></h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, smooth and smiling! I have loved thee well!</p>
<p>Hymned thee, and heard thee; lived beneath thy spell;</p>
<p>For years thy life-giving ozone have bless'd,</p>
<p>That makes loose garments tighter round the chest.</p>
<p>Paced in the dark thy sounding margent white,</p>
<p>And voiced my rapture in the boisterous night,</p>
<p>Striking the lurking coastguard with affright.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now on my barque&mdash;ah, no! no barque be mine!</p>
<p>On the new packet of the Angler Line,</p>
<p>I learn, too late, when fairly out at sea,</p>
<p>How well they speak who speak not well of thee</p>
<p>Implacable, inscrutable Emirs</p>
<p>Mock not the captured foe of bloodstained years</p>
<p>As thou hast mock'd one who ne'er did thee wrong,</p>
<p>Save in the venial fault of unexpressive song.</p>
<p>Or canst thou this unmeasured vengeance take,</p>
<p>Remembering some childish duck-and-drake,</p>
<p>Forgotten long, and never done in spite?</p>
<p>How could it harm thy navy-rending might,</p>
<p>Thou, whose huge waves in wanton affluence bang</p>
<p>Their heads against the rocks, in mid-air hang,</p>
<p>Up the sheer cliffs clamber with foamy claws,</p>
<p>And backward plunge again, with mad applause</p>
<p>Of all the turbulent, tumultuous press</p>
<p>That hurl themselves to spray in wantonness?</p>
<p>Prone, but unconquered, I have roll'd to leeward,</p>
<p>Soothed by the merciless mercy of the steward.</p>
<p>How can I stand when hardest steel and teak</p>
<p>Play a vertiginous game of hide-and-seek?</p>
<p>All is a-swing and dipping and a-roll.</p>
<p>Oh, vain material creed! Th' informing soul!</p>
<p>Proves well its immateriality,</p>
<p>Defying thus the tortures of the sea,</p>
<p>That force all else to helpless surrender;</p>
<p>For aught but very Spirit would prefer</p>
<p>To seek at once the illimitable inane,</p>
<p>Than cognisant of anguish thus remain</p>
<p>The tenant of a desolated shrine,</p>
<p>A bare clay cabin, like this frame of mine.</p>
<p>Oh, rich saloons! Oh, rooms of wretched state!</p>
<p>The pomp and glory of you all I hate!</p>
<p>Ye fulsome diving dados, would ye were</p>
<p>Extinct as your vocabular congener!</p>
<p>Place me where errant icebergs, anchored deep</p>
<p>By chains of frost, a darkling vigil keep,</p>
<p>Fixed in the pole's impenetrable wall,</p>
<p>Dead to the warmer ocean's roving call!</p>
<p>Far from this liquid way that heaves and rolls,</p>
<p>This world-long switchback, bounded by the poles,</p>
<p>This path of pain, whose undulations cease</p>
<p>Only in that palæocrystic peace!</p>
<p>Nay, what is this? How steady! Here we are!</p>
<p>Field breezes mingle with the oil and tar,</p>
<p>And with a shudder I behold anear</p>
<p>The solid weed-hung timbers of the pier.</p>
<p>Perfidious sea! I'll trust thee never more,</p>
<p>And mock thy fury safely from the shore.</p>

["He fully admitted the difficulties of the Government and Sir <span class="sc">Henry
Loch</span>. Both found themselves to be in a most exceptionally difficult
position, created by those who had gone before them by granting in the
wrong way the charter to the Company. He admitted that both Lord <span class="sc">Ripon</span>
and Sir <span class="sc">Henry Loch</span> did their best in the circumstances for a long time to
maintain peace; both urged that war should be avoided.... Mr. <span class="sc">Rhodes</span>
was Prime Minister of Cape Colony, and obviously Sir <span class="sc">Henry Loch</span> had an
exceedingly difficult position in dealing as Prime Minister and as the head
of the Company with that gentleman, to whom he could not say that he did
not quite believe him, and that he was forcing on the war."&mdash;<i>Mr. Labouchere
on the Chartered Company and Matabeleland.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>grandly</i>). "Walk up, walk up, ladies and gentlemen!
See the great African live lion, Matabele&mdash;called Lo Ben
for short&mdash;larger than (average) life, and thrice as natural as
normal (menagerie) nature! Walk up! Walk up! Taming
process just about to begin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Agent of Menagerie Proprietor</i> (<i>sotto voce</i>). Oh, well you
know&mdash;subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>
of course, to&mdash;ahem!&mdash;every provision being made
for&mdash;a&mdash;<i>humanity</i>&mdash;and&mdash;ahem&mdash;every
precaution being taken against&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;needless
risks, you know, and&mdash;a&mdash;obvious cruelty, you see&mdash;and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;all
that sort of thing, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>nettled</i>). No, I <i>don't</i> know, dontcher know. And
what's more I don't believe <i>you</i> know, dontcher know, nor your
guv'nors neither, for that matter. What <i>is</i> your little game,
anyhow?</p>

<p><i>Agent</i> (<i>with some assumption of dignity</i>). We have <i>no</i> "little
game." Little Game is not the word. Lions, I believe, are generally
called "Big Game," by <span class="sc">Nimrods</span> and others.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>Sniggers as one who has scored.</i></p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>sardonically</i>). <span class="sc">Nimrod</span>, indeed! Ah! a mighty
hunter before the Lords <i>you</i> are, ain't you? You and your lot!
Rural rabbits and parochial foxes are G&mdash;&mdash;'s "Big Game," eh?</p>

<p><i>Agent.</i> This is neither the time nor the place to argue that point.
Your business is lion-taming; ours is menagerie-managing.</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>scornfully</i>). All right, my noble swell! Manage
<i>him!</i></p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>Pointing to Lion, who is ramping and roaring.</i></p>

<p><i>Agent.</i> Not at all, not at all!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>Spectators become impatient.</i></p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer.</i> Well, look here, do you want this lion tamed for
you, or do you <i>not</i>?</p>

<p><i>Agent.</i> Why, cert'n'ly! Subject of course to the assistance&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I
<i>should</i> say <i>supervision</i> of <span class="sc">Loch</span> and myself.</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer.</i> Ah, "supervise" away as much as you please, only
don't interfere with me. The old game! Stand by while I do the
dangerous part of the business, hamper me as much as you can, and
when, in spite of you all, I am successfully through, take the business&mdash;and
the credit&mdash;over yourselves!</p>

<p><i>Agent</i> (<i>aside</i>). Wonderful man, very. Wish I quite knew what
to make of him. Lion-tamers, like fire, are excellent servants, but
bad masters. All alike, all alike, <span class="sc">Clive</span>, <span class="sc">Warren Hastings</span>,
Rajah <span class="sc">Brooke</span>, Jamaica <span class="sc">Eyre</span>, <span class="sc">Bartle Frere</span>,
<span class="sc">Gordon</span>, all wonderful,
and&mdash;in the end&mdash;very useful, but worrying, worrying!</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>proceeding</i>). Walk up, walk up, ladies and
gentlemen! All in to begin! See the big black-maned African
lion, fresh from Mashonaland wilds; bigger than <span class="sc">Churchill</span> ever
chased or <span class="sc">Selous</span> slew, or <span class="sc">Van Amburgh</span> subdued, tamed in the
twinkling of an assegai, conquered in the 'tss! of a Hotchkiss, by
the Great South African Lion-Tamer, <span class="sc">Rhodorowdidow</span> the Rumbistical.</p>

<p><i>Spectators.</i> Hooray! Hooray!! Hoo-<i>ray!!!</i></p>

<p><i>Agent</i> (<i>aside</i>). How wonderfully popular these thrasonical wild-beast
tamers and prancing proconsul sort of fellows are&mdash;with the gallery!</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>to attendant</i>). I say, just hand me the loaded whip,
and&mdash;keep the poker hot, in case of emergency&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Agent</i> (<i>hurriedly</i>). Oh, here, I say; that will never do,
<span class="sc">Rhodorowdidow</span>!</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Agent.</i> Why, you know, loaded bludgeons and red-hot pokers <i>read</i>
too much like&mdash;<i>Cruelty to Animals!</i> What <i>would</i> <span class="sc">Labby</span> and
the Humanitarians say? You're none too popular already, you know,
in certain quarters. Your masterful little ways and monetary
success have put a good many backs up. We mustn't run any needless
risks, <span class="sc">Rhodo</span>. <i>Wouldn't</i> this little toy-whip and this big
bottle of (<i>medicated</i>) rose-water do as well?</p>

<p><i>Lion-Tamer</i> (<i>scornfully</i>). <i>Was it with Rose-water that "John

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span> XIV.&mdash;<i>The Study at Hornbeam Lodge.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday night, about</i> 11.30. Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>is
alone</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Oh the inestimable blessing of having
nothing on one's mind again! How providential that I found
<span class="sc">Larkins</span> in! He was a little unsympathetic at first, to be sure; he
<i>would</i> have it that I must have known all along what the
Eldorado really was! but as soon as he saw how strongly I felt
about it, he was <i>most</i> helpful. I could <i>not</i> have gone to that place
this evening; how could I have met <span class="sc">Cornelia's</span> eye after it? As it
is, I can face her without&mdash;&mdash; Surely she is later than usual from
this Zenana meeting! (<i>Wheels are heard outside.</i>) A cab? I do
hope nothing is the matter! Why, that sounds like&mdash;like a <i>latchkey!</i>
Can it be&mdash;ah!&mdash;a dispute with the cabman&mdash;it <i>must</i> be
<span class="sc">Cornelia</span>!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>The front door bangs.</i></p>

<p><i>A Voice</i> (<i>in earnest remonstrance through the keyhole</i>). 'Ere, I
say, you don't sneak off like <i>that</i>, you know! I <i>knowed</i> you was
no good the minnit I clapped
eyes on you! Are you going to
gimme my legal fare or not?
I ain't goin' till I git it. I
want another shellin' orf o' you
I do!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
Another shilling? Why, it's
under a mile! He little knows
my wife's principles if he
expects&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Voice.</i> You orter be
<i>ashimed</i> o' yourself! A lydy
like you to tyke a man orf his
rank at this toime o' noight,
all the w'y from&mdash;&mdash;(<i>The
front door is hastily unlocked
again.</i>) Thankee, mum, thankee;
lor, I only want what's my doo,
and the distance 'ere from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>The door shuts with a bang.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> She's given him
the extra shilling&mdash;she <i>can't</i> be
well! I'm afraid she's really
poorly. She's gone into the
drawing-room, but there are no
lights there. She'll be here
directly.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He sits up expectantly.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, in the
hall</i>). Just as I expected.
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span> not home yet! I
shall sit up for him in the
study. (<i>She opens the study
door, and starts</i>.) So <i>there</i> you
are, Pa! And pray when did
<i>you</i> come in?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>mildly</i>). Yes, my
love, here I am; I've been in a
long while, quite a long while.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). And
he imagines I believe <i>that!</i>
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I understood you intended
to spend the evening
with <span class="sc">Charles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> So I did, my dear, so I did. I went to his rooms.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> And you went out somewhere together, Pa? Come,
you won't deny <i>that!</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). What a mercy I didn't go to that
Eldorado! I should have <i>had</i> to tell her! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why you see
we&mdash;we didn't go anywhere. I found <span class="sc">Charles</span> was engaged to dine
with a friend, so I went away again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). A very likely story! Where has
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span>
learnt such brazen duplicity? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh! and then of
course you came straight home?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Why, no, my love; not immediately. I&mdash;I suddenly
recollected that I had to see a friend on&mdash;on a little matter of business
which was&mdash;hem&mdash;somewhat pressing, so I went there first of all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, contemptuously</i>). Exactly the excuse in all
those horrid songs! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And the business kept you rather
late, eh, Pa? Some business <i>is</i> apt to do so, I know!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She makes me almost feel as if I'd gone
after all! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I <i>was</i> a little late, my dear, not so very. I
suppose I must have been home between eight and nine, and <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>
brought me up some nice cold mutton and the apple-tart, so I did
very well, very well indeed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). If he is deceiving me, I can soon find
out
from the look of the joint and tart!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> By the way, my love, surely <i>you</i> are rather late this
evening, are you not? it's nearly twelve!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, with a start</i>). Oh, but I will <i>not</i>
fib unless
he forces me to. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I was detained later than I expected.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> And you didn't expect to be back so very early either,
for you took the latchkey, didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Toov.</span> I happened to find it, Pa, and I thought I might as
well use it&mdash;and why not?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> It was most thoughtful of you, my love, to think of
saving <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>. By the way, do you notice&mdash;&mdash;? (<i>He looks round
him suspiciously.</i>) Ah, well, it may be my fancy. And you had a
successful meeting? were there many interesting speeches?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov</i> (<i>choking</i>). As&mdash;as interesting as usual,
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span>!
(<i>To herself.</i>) I 'm sure <i>that's</i> true enough!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> And supper provided afterwards, I suppose? Which
accounts for your being late. Dear&mdash;dear me!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>His face grows troubled again.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Is there any reason why there <i>shouldn't</i> be supper
afterwards, Pa?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Not in <i>that</i> house.
Our dear friends the <span class="sc">Cumberbatches</span>
do everything on such
a truly hospitable scale. Now,
most people in their position
would have considered tea and
coffee and sandwiches <i>quite</i> sufficient.
Was it a <i>hot</i> supper, my
love?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Yes&mdash;no&mdash;<i>rather</i>
hot&mdash;I didn't
notice. You ask such preposterous
questions, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I didn't mean to.
I was just a little surprised,
do you know, at your taking a
cab for such a short distance. I
thought you might have felt
unwell; but perhaps dear Mrs.
<span class="sc">Cumberbatch</span> insisted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Why, of course,
Pa; you know how kind and
considerate she is; otherwise
I should never have dreamed
of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Just what I
thought, my love. But wasn't
the cabman rather uncivil? I
wonder you gave way to him&mdash;unless,
of course, he was drunk.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> He <i>was</i>&mdash;disgracefully
drunk, Pa; if you
heard so much, you must have
noticed that; and how you
could sit quietly here and never
think of coming to my assistance!
Ah, it is hardly for <i>you</i>
to reproach me for submitting
to his extortion!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Indeed, my love,
I'd no idea&mdash;you are generally
so very firm with cabmen that&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>Changing the subject.</i>)
By-the-bye, I don't know if you
noticed a note for you lying on the hall table? It must have come
after you left. It looked to me wonderfully like dear Mrs.
<span class="sc">Cumberbatch's</span>
writing, but what could she have to write about when
she would be seeing you directly? Did she allude to it at all?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> From <span class="sc">Eliza Cumberbatch</span>? No; at least, she&mdash;I'll
go and get it. (<i>She goes into the hall and finds the note.</i>) Good
gracious, it <i>is</i> <span class="sc">Eliza's</span> hand! (<i>She reads it hurriedly under
the hall-lamp.</i>)
"Just a line. Zenana meeting postponed at last moment.
Will let you know when another day fixed. Well, it will save me
the trouble of writing to her; but, oh dear, the stories I've been
telling Pa! But he's as bad&mdash;I <i>know</i> he's as bad!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>as</i> Mrs. T. <i>returns</i>). So you found the note,
<span class="sc">Cornelia</span>,
and what does Mrs. <span class="sc">Cumberbatch</span> say?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>putting the note in the fire</i>). It&mdash;it was only
from&mdash;from
my dressmaker. (<i>To herself.</i>) He <i>drives</i> me to this!</p>

<p class="center">"Mrs. Toovey suddenly sits down, scarlet."</p></div>
<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>again uneasy</i>). Do you know, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, I&mdash;I may
be
wrong, but I've a very strong suspicion that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>in terror</i>). Pa, speak out! In&mdash;in the name of
Heaven, <i>what</i> is it you suspect?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> It's getting stronger every moment. I'm sure of it.
My love, there's a strange man downstairs in the kitchen!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with a gasp of relief</i>). A man! Oh, this must be
seen into at once! (<i>She rings the bell furiously; presently</i>
<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>
<i>appears, evidently only half-awake</i>.) <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>, what does this
mean? I insist on the truth!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i>. I'm very sorry m'm, but I'd no idea you was home, and
I was sitting up for you downstairs, and I expect I must have
dropped asleep, and never heard you come in.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Don't attempt to deceive <i>me!</i> You are entertaining
a man downstairs, contrary to all my orders. Yes, it's useless to
deny it, your master has distinctly heard sounds.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> No, my love, I can't exactly say as much as that&mdash;but&mdash;yes,
every time the door opens it's more perceptible! (<i>He sniffs.</i>)
Don't you observe yourself, my dear, a remarkably strong odour of
tobacco-smoke? Now, as I never have been a smoker myself, it
stands to reason that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>Mrs. T. suddenly sits down, scarlet.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>roused</i>). I'm sure if you and master suspect me of
concealing followers downstairs, you're welcome to search as much as
you please! Cook's gone up to bed hours ago, and for a poor girl
to be kep' up to this time o' night, and then have her character
took away&mdash;why, I'm not accustomed to such treatment, and, what's
more, put up with it I <i>won't</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, guiltily</i>). It's that filthy smoke at the
Eldorado! (<i>Aloud.</i>) <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>, how can you have such
ridiculous fancies? Tobacco, indeed! I&mdash;<i>I</i> don't notice anything.
<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>, it was a mistake of your master's; I don't blame you in the
least. There, you've sat up long enough, go to bed, go, girl!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> Beggin' your pardon, m'm, but insinuations have been
descended to which I can't pass over in a hurry, and before I go I
should wish&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>feverishly</i>). I tell you it was all a mistake. Your
master will apologise for it. Pa, say you're sorry!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> I don't require no apologies from <i>master</i>, m'm. I can
make allowances for <i>him</i>&mdash;more partickler as there's no mistake
about there being a smell of tobaccer-smoke. I don't wonder at
<i>anyone</i> noticing it. It's your sending for me like this, and trying
to shift the blame on the innercent, when all the time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). This is too intolerable! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Haven't I <i>said</i> I didn't blame you, you unreasonable girl! Let us
have no more of this impertinence! Leave us!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> I will, m'm, as soon as ever you can get suited, for, to
tell you the truth, I don't like such goings on as these; and I'll
take care I get a good character, too, or I'll know the reason why!
(<i>As she closes the door.</i>) And I 'ope master will satisfy himself
where the smell of tobacco reelly <i>does</i> come from, I'm sure; it isn't
from <i>downstairs!</i></p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She vanishes, leaving Mrs. T. petrified.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> You see, my love, it couldn't have been all my fancy,
because <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> noticed it too. Dear me, it's late; I'd better go
and see that everything is locked up. (<i>As he passes</i> Mrs. T.) It's
very extraordinary. Surely they don't allow any of the missionaries
to smoke at these Zenana meetings, my love&mdash;do they?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Of course they don't. I&mdash;I am at a loss to understand
you. <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>, and&mdash;and I am going to bed.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> No, but really&mdash;&mdash; Why, I <i>see</i> how it was! Depend
upon it, my dear, that cabman must have been sitting inside the
vehicle smoking, with the windows up, before you got in. Yes, yes;
that accounts for everything.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Do you think so, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>? I&mdash;I
remember noticing a smell of cigars.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>as he goes out</i>). My poor dear love, <i>what</i> a trial
for
you; and you never complained! Now, when I see dear Mrs. <span class="sc">Cumberbatch</span>
at church to-morrow, I must really caution her not to
employ that cabman again&mdash;she may have taken his number, and he
really ought to lose his licence&mdash;drunk, and smoking inside his cab!
Oh, I shall tell her!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>alone</i>). Pa shall <i>not</i> go to church to-morrow.
<i>I</i> will
take care of that, and by the time he sees <span class="sc">Eliza</span> again he will have
forgotten all about it. Is he doing all this to cover his own misdoings?
I can't rest till I know! I will make <span class="sc">Charles</span> tell me on
Monday. But what if Pa is blameless? No, he must have been
doing <i>something</i> he oughtn't to. It would be too horrible if it turned
out that I&mdash;<i>I</i> am the only person who has been (<i>she catches her
breath with a shudder</i>) "hi-tiddley-ing," as those vulgar wretches
would call it! There 's only one comfort that I can see; nobody

<h2>TWO VIEWS OF VICTORY.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">The Past.</span></h4>

<p>THE Commander who had fought so bravely was tired out. He
could go no farther. He had beaten back the stubborn foe, and
there was nothing more for him to do. He waited with as much
patience as he could muster the return of his messengers. In a
short time he would learn whether the honour of his country had
been preserved; whether his battle was a defeat or a victory.</p>

<p>"Will they never come?" he murmured. "Surely by this time
they should have learned the truth?"</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words when the scouts returned.</p>

<p>"General," cried the leader, "your campaign has been crowned
with success! England is herself again! Your reward is assured!"</p>

<p>And it was. A week later he was made a K.C.B.!</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Future.</span></h4>

<p>The Commander who had contended with the stubborn foe with a
spirit of stern determination was at length exhausted. He had put
to flight the enemies who at every step had attempted to bar his
progress. But now the affair was over, and there was little for him
to do; so he was waiting as patiently as he could the return of those
he had sent forward to represent him in the proper quarter. Before
long he would receive the intelligence for which he hungered. He
would be told whether all was right or all was wrong; whether his
battle was a defeat or a victory.</p>

<p>"Will they never come?" he murmured. "Surely by this time
they should have revealed the truth, and made the most of the
opportunity."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words when the scouts came back.</p>

<p>"General," cried the leader, "your campaign has been crowned
with success! Capel Court is itself again! The Stocks have gone
up 15, and your success is assured!"</p>

<p>And it was. A week later and he found himself a millionaire!</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Fisher Unwin</span> is, my
Baronite writes, still engaged in
the important work, some time
ago undertaken by his house, of
publishing <i>The Story of the
Nations</i>. The last volume issued
is the thirty-fifth, in which Mr.
<span class="sc">Greville Tregarthen</span> deals
with the History of the Australian
Commonwealth. Australasia
is a mere chit among
the nations of the world, and
story, God bless you, it has
hardly any to tell. It has
never been at war except with
the aboriginal settlers, who
were, at the outset, so lost to all
proper feeling as to resent the
incursion of the white man,
occasionally carrying their prejudice
to the absurd extent of
eating him. But this is ancient
history in a record which, beginning
a little more than a
hundred years ago with a convict
settlement&mdash;it was on
January 26, 1788, the British
flag was for the first time unfurled
in Sydney Bay&mdash;has
already spread out lusty limbs
over a vast Continent. <i>The
Story of the Nations</i> forms a
library of itself, and this last
volume is not the least fascinating
of the series.</p>

<p>The Baron, while greatly admiring
and certainly grateful
for the Diamond editions of all
the best works, and Diamond
editions should reproduce only
those that can be classed among
the "brilliants," of which two
or three specimens at a time can
be carried easily in the pocket
of an ulster, begs to remind
Messrs. <span class="sc">Routledge</span>, the republishers
of <span class="sc">Dickens's</span> works in
a very pocketable form, that
much of our journeying is
done by such gaslight as railway
companies supply, and
therefore, as this is not always
of the most powerful kind,
a book in small type, however
clear the type may be, is
unreadable. That is what the
publishers have to consider.
This excellent little pocket
volume of, for example, <i>The
Cricket on the Hearth</i>, is of no
use to the Baron when once out
of the pocket. True, the publishers
may say "it is intended
for the pocket only"; but if
this be the case, then the pockets
that would suffer would be
those of the publishers, not those
of the reading public. The
Baron's hints are well worth
consideration. For travelling,
the publishers might provide
and sell a small case containing
the Diamond edition and a portable
candle-lamp by which to
read it. Only this would rather
add to the expense, and with
every volume one does not wish
to be obliged to carry a candle-lamp.
Therefore, bigger and
clearer type. That's all. Try
it, and if it does not succeed,
blame the hitherto blameless</p>

<h2>THE BOGUS MANAGER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>
<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> Is it an easy thing to become the manager of a theatre?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> Why, certainly; you require no cash, and very little
credit.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it necessary that you should have any special training to
enable you to appropriately fill so responsible a position?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No. If you are sufficiently impudent, you may in the past have
been a betting-man, a crossing-sweeper, or an unqualified
dentist.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Will you have any difficulty in securing a theatre?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not at all. You will always find someone willing to accept
you as a lessee without making any inquiry as to your antecedents.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Having obtained a theatre, what is your next step?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> To get together a company. This is easily managed, as the
dramatic trade-journals give every week a long list of actors and
actresses who are "resting."</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What do you understand by such a word?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That the advertiser is much in need of an engagement, but is
too proud to acknowledge it.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Such a frame of mind is, I suppose,
favourable to hurried and unconsidered
engagements?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Quite so. It is an easy matter to
get an entire company on excellent terms.
Not that money is of any importance; for
you may as well promise five pounds a week
as five shillings, if you do not intend to pay.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Having secured your company, what
is the next step?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> To make them rehearse three weeks
or a month without a salary.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I suppose you have no trouble about
obtaining a piece on advantageous terms?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> None whatever. If you are lucky
you will get some conceited noodle to pay
you for producing his play; and if you are not so fortunate, why at
least you will get a drama, comedy, or burlesque for nothing.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Say that you are ready to begin, will you have any difficulty
in obtaining the preliminary announcements?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No. For having been trusted by the proprietor of the theatre,
the advertisement agents will follow suit, and you will obtain
sufficient publicity to balance your requirements.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And what will take place on and after the opening of the
playhouse under your management?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> You will get more or less ready money taken at the doors
during five days of the week, with which you can safely decamp
without paying anybody on or before the sixth.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Will not your sudden departure cause some inconvenience to
a large number of persons connected with the enterprise?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Assuredly. Many of the company you have engaged will starve,
and the other parties to the proceedings will use strong language as
they wipe off your liability as a bad debt.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it possible that you will be made a bankrupt?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not only possible, but probable.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And will this end your theatrical career?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Why, of course not. All you will
have to do is to take a little holiday.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And after the holiday, what next?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Why, then you can secure another
theatre and repeat the proceedings with
exactly similar results.</li>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, November 6.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> in fine
form to-night; made one of those speeches that distinctly enhance
Parliamentary reputation. Ticklish situation for Leader of Opposition
in face of Parish Councils Bill. Won't do, with General
Election within measurable distance, to declare plump against it;
still less will it suit party to support one of principal measures of
a Government whose successive steps, however devious, are all
bent upon goal of Home Rule. For two nights men rising from
Opposition benches have endeavoured to wriggle through this
difficulty; been more or less unsuccessful; <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, with
sure aim and light touch, does and says exactly right thing.</p>

<p>By all means let <span class="sc">Hodge</span> have a voice in direction of his own
affairs; his best friend, the party who spent themselves in his behalf
in Corn-Law days, who acted in his best interests whenever question
of political enfranchisement or his relations to parson and
squire cropped up&mdash;the great Tory party would be the very last
to slacken effort for his prosperity. So anxious are they on the
score, they would not imperil opportunity by throwing out this
Bill on the Second Reading. But <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> showed, in
little asides, that this particular measure is badly conceived, not
nearly so good as what would have befallen <span class="sc">Hodge</span> had a Unionist
Ministry been in office. For an hour the <span class="sc">Prince</span> spoke, displaying
perfect mastery of the subject, managing, without assuming a
hostile attitude, to bestow upon the measure some damaging blows.</p>

<p>First time since House met Mr. G. began to show that keen
interest in proceedings which he seemed to have reserved for Home
Rule Bill. Sat listening intently with hand to ear as <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>
gracefully glided on from point to point. Pretty little sparring
match when <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> endeavoured to draw him into doing
something damaging, either in the way of reticence or declaration,
touching <span class="sc">George Russell's</span> explosive speech on Friday night. "I
would not," observed <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, "have said so much, but
I presume that in this matter the hon. gentleman represented
the Government of which he is a member."
Mr. G. shook his head. "Then he disclaims it?"
Mr. G. shook his head again. "Oh, then, though he does
not dissociate himself from the Under-secretary of India,
he does not associate the Government with his remarks?" Mr.
G. again shook his head, finally explaining that his
young friend and colleague had merely revived former custom&mdash;existing
"in my early days"&mdash;whereby Ministers not in the Cabinet
and not connected with department specially concerned
in matter at issue, might enter at large into general debate.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More debate on Parish Councils Bill.
As usual, adjourned at midnight. Motion made that House
forthwith adjourn, <span class="sc">Oliver Rollit</span> asks for more. Too early
to go home; might as well sit up till
one o'clock, and take private Bills. House aghast. <span class="sc">Squire of
Malwood</span> discreetly says he will think the matter over.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Another night on Parish Councils. Debate should have
finished last night; finally arranged to close it before dinner hour
to-day; but it dribbled on to midnight. As there was an hour to
spare, <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, who since Session resumed has been silent in
six languages, thought he might as well say a few words. Romped
in at half-past ten; awkward this; about the hour when <span class="sc">Jokim</span> had
intended to lift debate out of rut by one of his luminous speeches.
<span class="sc">Thomas</span>, however, thought House would prefer to hear him. At
any rate, he provided opportunity. When at length <span class="sc">Jokim</span> spoke upon
subject on which he is supreme authority, House almost empty,
altogether languid.</p>

<p>Brightened up for moment at <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood's</span> happy wit.
<span class="sc">Jokim</span>, following on line trekked by <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, suggested
that half of Bill dealing with Poor Law matters should be abandoned.
"According to judgment of <span class="sc">Solomon</span>," said the <span class="sc">Squire</span>, "it was
the true mother who would not consent to divide her child in two."</p>

<p>A dreary night made endurable by incursion of
<span class="sc">Knatchbull-Hugessen</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Herbert
Thomas</span>, of Faversham division of Kent. For
many years his brother sat in House till he finally wobbled into a
peerage, and, as <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> said, wore his coronet as a crown of
thorns because it had been given him by Mr. G. When he was
with us here, and one turned to <i>Dod</i> to find him under heading
"<span class="sc">Hugessen</span>," there was discovered instruction "See
<span class="sc">Knatchbull-Hugessen</span>."
This was explained at the time on score that no one
from day to day exactly knew where <i>Hugessen</i> was.</p>

<p>Different with his younger brother. "Sometimes," he said just
now, looking sorrowfully round the House, a gleam of comfort
brightening his eyes as they rested on a back view of <span class="sc">Jimmy
Lowther's</span> head, "I believe I'm the only Tory left in the House."</p>

<p>To-night up and smote Parish Councils Bill in uncompromising
speech. No truckling to Socialism. No bowing the knee to the Baal
<span class="sc">Hodge</span>. No leaning on the arm of Rimmon as he goes to worship in
the temple of the Compound Householder. The Bill another downward
step on the pathway dug out for the chariot of Free Trade;
the country going to dogs at accelerated pace.</p>

<p>Small House, but it listened with delight to the most thoroughly
honest speech heard from any bench through many Parliaments.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Parish Councils Bill read second time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Still smiling at <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> joke; led up to
with great skill; last touch of art given in the look of startled surprise
with which he regarded uproariously laughing audience. Was
passing eulogy on <span class="sc">Rhodes</span> and the Chartered Company, forasmuch
as, whilst certainly mowing down the Matabele with the Maxim
gun, they had spread the benefits of civilisation, "extending railways,
extending telegraphs, extending roads."</p>

<p>The Clark of the House causing a Division.</p></div>

<p>"Exactly," said the <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>. "I spoke for an
hour and a half, and <span class="sc">Balfour</span> puts what I had meant to say in a phrase.
What is all this action in Mashonaland, this spending of money, and making
of war, but the Extension of <span class="sc">Rhodes</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Maguire</span> undertook to defend Chartered Company
against attack of <span class="sc">Sage</span>. "Terrible work, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he
said, mopping his heated brow. "Much rather approach
<span class="sc">Lobengula's</span> kraal itself than stand up and face the House."</p>

<p>Had to be done, however, and <span class="sc">Maguire</span> not the man
to run away from anything approaching a fight. Still
he observed precaution of getting as near the door as
possible, speaking from remote end of bench, almost
outside limits of bar. Also he found some subtle comfort, strength,
and consolation in standing on one leg whilst he addressed the
Speaker. Sometimes it was the right leg, sometimes the left.
Whether on one or the other&mdash;not for a moment on two&mdash;he described
to the charmed House how the cherished object of Mr. <span class="sc">Rhodes</span>, the
one desire upon which all the energies of the Chartered Company were
bent, was that the men of Matabele should "marry and settle down."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Discussion of affairs in Matabeleland.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Debate on <span class="sc">M'Laren's</span> Amendment to Employers' Liability
Bill brought to conclusion at midnight. Thought it would be all
over before dinner; dragged on hour after hour with ever deepening
depression. Seems as if already, in this first fortnight of Autumn
Session, energy's sapped; dulness certainly dominant.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said <span class="sc">The Squire of Malwood</span>, "there is no
fight about the House now <span class="sc">Joseph</span> is awa'. Hear he is coming back
towards end of next week, balmy from the Bahamas, breezy from
the Atlantic. I shouldn't at all wonder if, upon his arrival, a genial
change was wrought in things generally."</p>

number of my pals are constantly loafing round the station in our
suburb waiting for a job of luggage-carrying, or if we aren't exactly
<i>at</i> the station, we are always to be found at the Public just opposite.
Will it be believed that passengers actually prefer to engage this
avaricious blackleg, the Out-Porter, instead of employing <i>us!</i> Their
paltry excuse is that he charges less than we do and is more civil.
That <i>shows</i> him to be a contemptible blackleg! Only a serf of our
present miserable social arrangements is ever civil to anybody.
Call him an Out-Porter! If me and my pals catch him one of
these dark nights we'll make an Out-Patient of him! Is the mere
convenience of the public for ever to override the legitimate claims
of the deserving unemployed?&mdash;<span class="sc">Corner Boy.</span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
